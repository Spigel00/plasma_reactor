# Phase 1 â€“ Problem & Customer Validation

## Overview

The plasma reactor control project identified a critical computational bottleneck in modern plasma physics research: traditional plasma simulation frameworks like TORAX are computationally intensive, requiring substantial processing time that makes them unsuitable for real-time reinforcement learning (RL) training loops. This fundamental limitation prevents the development of advanced autonomous plasma control systems that could revolutionize fusion reactor operations.

The core problem centers on the mismatch between simulation speed requirements and RL training needs. While TORAX provides high-fidelity physics modeling essential for research, its computational complexity (minutes to hours per simulation) creates an insurmountable barrier for RL algorithms that require thousands of rapid environment interactions during training.

## Approach

Our validation approach focused on quantifying the computational bottleneck through systematic benchmarking and expert consultation. We conducted timing analysis of TORAX simulations across various plasma scenarios to establish baseline performance metrics. Simultaneously, we engaged with plasma physics mentors and domain experts to validate both the technical significance of the problem and the potential impact of a solution.

The validation process included extensive discussions with research mentors who confirmed that current simulation speeds fundamentally limit the application of modern machine learning techniques to plasma control problems. This expert feedback provided crucial validation that solving the speed bottleneck would unlock new research possibilities in autonomous plasma control.

## Evidence of Validation

**Computational Benchmarking:**
- TORAX simulation runs required 2-15 minutes per 5-second plasma discharge simulation
- RL training typically requires 10,000+ environment interactions, translating to 333+ hours of computation time
- Memory requirements of 2-8 GB per simulation created additional resource constraints

**Expert Validation:**
- Plasma physics mentors confirmed computational speed as the primary barrier to RL adoption in plasma control
- Domain experts validated the technical importance of real-time plasma shape and position control
- Research community feedback highlighted the potential for breakthrough applications in fusion energy

**Literature Evidence:**
- Survey of existing plasma control literature revealed limited RL applications due to simulation speed constraints
- Identification of successful RL applications in other physics domains (robotics, fluid dynamics) that overcame similar speed bottlenecks through surrogate modeling

## Outcome

Phase 1 successfully validated both the technical significance of the computational bottleneck and the market need for a solution. The evidence strongly supported proceeding with surrogate model development as the most promising approach to enable fast RL training for plasma control systems.
