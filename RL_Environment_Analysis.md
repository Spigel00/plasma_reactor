## üìà **Performance Results Analysis**

### **Training Performance (20,000 timesteps)**

Of course, here is the aligned table:

| Metric                | Value               | Status               |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Training Episodes** | ~400 episodes       | ‚úÖ Completed         |
| **Episode Length**    | 50 steps (max)      | ‚úÖ Consistent        |
| **Training Reward**   | -876 avg            | ‚ö†Ô∏è Poor Performance  |
| **Training Stability**| No crashes/divergence ‚úÖ Stable            |
| **Model Convergence** | Consistent policy   | ‚úÖ Converged         |

### **Policy Behavior Analysis**

#### **Learned Control Strategy:**
```python
# Trained agent consistently outputs:
Coil Currents: [5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0] kA
```

**Critical Finding**: Agent learned to **minimize coil currents** to avoid control penalties, but this leads to poor plasma control.

#### **Detailed Performance Breakdown:**

**Test Results (3 episodes):**
- **Episode Reward**: -525.82 (consistent across all tests)
- **Targets Met**: 0/5 (complete failure to meet any control objectives)
- **Control Actions**: Fixed at minimum values [5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0] kA
- **Plasma Response**: Severe deviation from targets

**Specific Parameter Deviations:**
```python
# Target vs Actual Performance
Initial Plasma State Examples:
Episode 1: Œ∫=1.601 ‚Üí 1.089 (target: 1.8)  ‚ùå 39% deviation  
Episode 2: Œ¥=0.298 ‚Üí -0.244 (target: 0.4) ‚ùå 161% deviation
Episode 3: R=6.212m ‚Üí 6.xxx m (target: 1.65m) ‚ùå 275% deviation
```

### **Baseline Comparison Results**

| Strategy | Avg Reward | Performance Level |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Random Policy** | -7.78 | Poor |
| **Fixed Baseline** [10,8,12,6] | +75.87 | **Good** ‚≠ê |
| **Simple Heuristic** | +114.57 | **Very Good** ‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| **Trained RL Agent** | -525.82 | **Very Poor** ‚ùå |

**Key Insight**: Simple baseline policies significantly outperform the trained RL agent, indicating fundamental issues with reward design or training approach.

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### **1. Reward Function Issues**

#### **Current Reward Structure:**
```python
# Reward components (from plasma_control_env.py)
shape_reward = 10.0 * (2.0 - elongation_error - triangularity_error)    # Max +20
position_reward = 5.0 * (1.0 - R_error - 2.0 * Z_error)               # Max +5  
performance_reward = 5.0 * (1.0 - Ip_error)                            # Max +5
stability_reward = 2.0 (if q95 > 2.0) else -10.0 * (2.0 - q95)       # +2 or negative
control_penalty = -0.1 * sum((action - 10.0)**2)                       # Penalty for deviation
```

**Problems Identified:**

1. **Excessive Penalties**: Large negative rewards for poor control discourage exploration
2. **Control Penalty Dominance**: Agent learns to minimize coil currents to avoid quadratic penalty
3. **Sparse Positive Rewards**: Very difficult to achieve positive rewards simultaneously
4. **Unbalanced Components**: Shape errors can easily dominate total reward

#### **Mathematical Analysis:**
```python
# Typical reward calculation for [5,5,5,5] action:
shape_reward = 10.0 * (2.0 - 0.711 - 0.644) = 6.45        # Poor but positive
position_reward = 5.0 * (1.0 - 4.567 - 2*0.244) = -26.28  # Large negative  
performance_reward = 5.0 * (1.0 - 0.1) = 4.5               # Good
stability_reward = 2.0                                       # Good
control_penalty = -0.1 * (25 + 9 + 49 + 16) = -9.9        # Moderate penalty

Total ‚âà -23.23  # Net negative despite some good components
```

### **2. Training Configuration Issues**

#### **Insufficient Training Time:**
- **Current**: 20,000 timesteps (~400 episodes)
- **Recommended**: 100,000+ timesteps for complex continuous control
- **Industry Standard**: 1M+ timesteps for robust policies

#### **Hyperparameter Analysis:**
```python
# Current vs Recommended
learning_rate=3e-4     # ‚úÖ Appropriate
n_steps=1024          # ‚ö†Ô∏è  Could increase to 2048  
batch_size=64         # ‚ö†Ô∏è  Could increase to 256
ent_coef=0.01         # ‚ö†Ô∏è  Too low - limits exploration
```

### **3. Environment Design Issues**

#### **Action Space Constraints:**
```python
# Current: Box([5,5,5,5], [15,15,15,15])  
# Issue: Minimum bound of 5 kA may be too restrictive
# Our surrogate baseline uses: [10,8,12,6] kA
```

#### **Observation Scaling:**
- Different plasma parameters have vastly different scales
- No normalization applied (R~6m, Œ∫~1.5, Œ¥~0.3, Ip~15MA)
- Agent may struggle with multi-scale learning

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Detailed Improvement Recommendations**

### **Priority 1: Reward Function Redesign**

#### **1.1 Implement Progressive Reward Shaping**
```python
def improved_reward_function(self, plasma_responses, action):
    """Redesigned reward with better balance and shaping."""
    
    # 1. Normalize errors to [0,1] scale
    elongation_error_norm = min(abs(plasma_responses['elongation'] - self.target_elongation) / 0.5, 1.0)
    triangularity_error_norm = min(abs(plasma_responses['triangularity'] - self.target_triangularity) / 0.2, 1.0)
    
    # 2. Use exponential rewards (more forgiving)  
    shape_reward = 20.0 * np.exp(-2.0 * (elongation_error_norm + triangularity_error_norm))
    
    # 3. Reduce control penalty magnitude
    control_penalty = -0.01 * np.sum((action - 10.0)**2)  # 10x smaller
    
    # 4. Add progress rewards
    if elongation_error_norm < 0.1 and triangularity_error_norm < 0.1:
        bonus_reward = 50.0  # Large bonus for simultaneous success
    
    return shape_reward + position_reward + performance_reward + control_penalty + bonus_reward
```

#### **1.2 Implement Curriculum Learning**
```python
class CurriculumPlasmaEnv(PlasmaControlEnv):
    """Progressive difficulty environment."""
    
    def __init__(self, difficulty_level=1):
        # Level 1: Loose targets, large rewards
        # Level 2: Moderate targets  
        # Level 3: Tight targets (final performance)
        pass
```

### **Priority 2: Training Configuration Improvements**

#### **2.1 Extended Training Protocol**
```python
# Recommended training configuration
training_config = {
    "total_timesteps": 200000,      # 10x current training
    "n_steps": 2048,               # Larger rollouts
    "batch_size": 256,             # Larger batches  
    "ent_coef": 0.05,              # More exploration
    "learning_rate": 1e-4,         # Slower, more stable learning
    "n_epochs": 20,                # More updates per rollout
}
```

#### **2.2 Algorithm Alternatives**
```python
# Test multiple algorithms
algorithms_to_test = {
    "SAC": {  # Better for continuous control
        "learning_rate": 3e-4,
        "batch_size": 256, 
        "train_freq": 1
    },
    "TD3": {  # Robust to hyperparameters
        "learning_rate": 1e-3,
        "batch_size": 100,
        "policy_delay": 2
    }
}
```

### **Priority 3: Environment Enhancements**

#### **3.1 Observation Normalization**
```python
class NormalizedPlasmaEnv(PlasmaControlEnv):
    """Environment with normalized observations."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Define normalization parameters
        self.obs_mean = np.array([1.65, 0.0, 1.8, 0.4, 15.0, 5.0, 15.0, 3.0])
        self.obs_std = np.array([0.2, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2, 5.0, 2.0, 5.0, 1.0])
    
    def normalize_obs(self, obs):
        return (obs - self.obs_mean) / self.obs_std
```

#### **3.2 Action Space Adjustment**
```python
# Recommended action space
self.action_space = spaces.Box(
    low=np.array([3.0, 3.0, 3.0, 3.0]),     # Lower minimum
    high=np.array([18.0, 18.0, 18.0, 18.0]), # Higher maximum  
    dtype=np.float32
)
```

### **Priority 4: Advanced Training Techniques**

#### **4.1 Multi-Objective Optimization**
```python
# Separate reward components for different objectives
rewards = {
    "shape_control": shape_reward,
    "position_control": position_reward,  
    "stability": stability_reward
}
# Use Pareto-efficient multi-objective RL (MOPPO)
```

#### **4.2 Imitation Learning Bootstrap**
```python
# Pre-train with successful baseline policy
expert_demonstrations = generate_expert_trajectories([10, 8, 12, 6])
# Use behavioral cloning before RL fine-tuning
```
